## Style Guidelines:

- Muted blue (#6699CC) for a sense of calm and trustworthiness, suitable for financial applications.
- Very light blue (#F0F8FF), almost white, providing a clean and uncluttered backdrop.
- Soft purple (#A98DCC), selected because it is close to blue in the color space, but different enough to highlight key elements. Offers good contrast with the primary blue without being too jarring.
- Inter (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable look that is suitable for displaying financial data.
- Use minimalistic line icons to represent different expense categories.
- Maintain a clean and spacious layout with clear visual hierarchy to present information effectively.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations when updating charts or displaying new data.
